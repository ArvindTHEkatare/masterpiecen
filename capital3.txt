Watching/reading entertainment is super fun and I assume a lot of people do watch movies and tv shows.
I like Anime and my favourite has to be Death note. I really love the plot.
Code geass is a close second. 

I love tv shows and animes that have intelligent characters.

Cat and mouse fights between 2 intelligent characters like sherlock holmes vs moriarity is quite exciting to watch
