When it comes to video games, I really love the souls-like genre.
I have only played dark souls 1, 3 and elden ring.
My favourite Souls like game has to be sekiro. A good chunk of people do not really count it as a souls like but atleast i do. 


I really loved taxi driver too. Watched it with a few friends.

Oh yeah taxi driver, as in the movie.
